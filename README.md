# urban biodiversity
Using land use, land use intensity and human population density to measure the impacts of urban expansion on biodiversity.

# data source
The two main rds files,"diversity" and "sites" could be downloaded from https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/the-2016-release-of-the-predicts-database, an open source project by the Natural History Museum's Biodiversity Informatics Group. (last updated on October 11, 2016)

# Methods for calculating the urban expansion rate of the chosen area(Novel approach)


# Methods for calculating the coefficients between the site-level biodiversity and the three chosen variables:land use,land use intensity and human population density (using R package "robustlmm")
Using "rlmer" function in package "robustlmm" to fit linear mixed effect models
